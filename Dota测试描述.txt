This evaluation of DOAI2019 Task1 is executed on 29th June 2021, by the detector named ReDet-SSP, which is used equivariant CNN and RoI Transformers, the training progress is on a computer which has a GPU named Nvidia Tesla K40c,  and during the traing process, the loss converaged to aound 0.6 , I executed test.py and parse_results.py to generate the last results, and packed them in Task1_results_nms.zip. The Total epoch is 12, we use traing set and validate set for traing, due to the high resolution, the images is divided into 1024*1024 by the DOTA_devkit. The size of the trained model is 257MB, and the total training prograss last 2 days. We gengeate the last resaults by this trained model, trying to evaluate by the test set.
